* there are some typo3.org specific fields in the Solr documents.
	- feel free to remove them and provide a hook instead

* currently indexes project information only

* Redmine's REST API for project information is limited:
	- hardcoded limit of 100 projects per request
	- need to remove hardcoded limit in
	- http://www.redmine.org/issues/7539
	- see redmine_7539.diff

	- projects sorted alphabetically instead by id
	- can't do incremental indexing b/c of alphabetic sorting
	- thus always doing full imports
